There are many things that I want to reach for myself, you know, yesterdey I watched Hometown Cha Cha Cha drama, I enjoyed watching it, deeply from my heart
I'm admiring Hye Jin as a woman, she's independent, strong, she can buy anything for herself through her effort, I mean she is great woman.
I hope I can be a independent strong woman, I feel like my conditions similiar as her. I also want to be like her, life that full of efforts, and doesn't waste my time.
So these following list are my resolutions:
1. To be a hard-working girl
2. 1 week 1 book
3. Improve my skills (python, and content marketing, it's really different but I need to divide my life into two conditions)
4. Do my best as a college student
5. I want to be a freelancer so I can work in any place
6. To be a traveller
7. I need financial freedom lol
8. The resolutions that I really really want is I want to become the best version of myself
